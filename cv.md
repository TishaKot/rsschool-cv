## Summary:

My name is Julia. I am an economist by training, but I have been working as an accountant for many years.

A year ago I became interested in programming, namely frontend, because I am a visual person.

I really want to master this profession in order to develop in this direction, adding new skills to my experience, and I hope studying at RS School will help me with this.

I am a very versatile person, sociable, I like to work in a team, share experiences, improving myself and others.

In my free time from work, I help homeless animals, pick them up from the street, treat them and find them new homes. This is my hobby.

In addition, I like to read various literature, run, walk a lot and prefer to relax in the fresh air.
